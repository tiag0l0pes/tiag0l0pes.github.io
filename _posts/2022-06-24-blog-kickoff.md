## Blog Kickoff

Hello World! This is my new blog. This blog was based on this [article](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). It was very simple to build and it is enough to keep log of my coding experiences.

---

In the next months I intent use this blog to log my development experiences. I'll touch topics like micro services, design patterns, clean code and other relevant topics.

Stay tuned! ðŸ˜Š
